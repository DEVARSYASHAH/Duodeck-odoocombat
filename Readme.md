## Behind the scenes

### Student app

We need this for writing our authentication views as well as student & department models. Student model has the first+last name ,department foreignkey and studentID which is one-to-one field to Django' User model. We use Django's User Model for authentication . There will be 3 views: login,signup and logout. The urls will have `/student/< login or signup or logout >/`.

### Library app

This is our main app where we will write our library system's main logic. It comprises of 4 models:

- **Author** - for storing name & description of author
- **Book** - for storing name , image ,category of a book & connecting to the author
- **Issue** - for tracking each & every issue a student requests. It will also track the book for which issue is requested , issue status (whether issued or not) , return status (whether returned or not) , return date (last date to return the book) and more...
- **Fine** - for tracking the fines & calculating fines automatically for each student whose issued book/s is/are not returned and the last date is passed

---

## Some important logics :

**Student ID** - Username of Django's User Model serves as our studentID

**Signing Up** - so every student who signs up creates a new user instance with his/her student id as the username and then a student instance is also created with the names and department and this user we just created.

**Calculating Fine - How ??** -
We run a for loop and pass all the issues to this calculate fine function. Then:

- for each issue , check whether the issue is issued or not (if issue is not issued then no need to calculate fines)

  - if issue is issued then check whether issue is returned or not (if issue is returned then no need to calculate fines)

    - if issue is not returned then check whether the issue's return date is passed or not (if not passed then no calculation of fines is needed)
      - create or get a fine instance with student & issue then calculate the amount and save it to the amount field

**Calculating Fine - When ??** -

- Whenever admin clicks on "_Calculate Fine_" button
- Whenever a student opens his "_My Fines_" page

**Payment of Fines**

- when a student clicks on pay button (in myfines page)
- we create a razorpay order with a dict containing fine amount (coverted to int and multiplied by 100 because razorpay wants in paisa) , order_id, currency
- then we send the user to the payfines page (payfines.html) with the amount (in paisa ) , razorpay key id, razorpay order id & amount (which should be displayed)
- user chooses proceed to payment online , selects paymode (Netbanking , Card , Wallet etc.) and pays the amount
- we verify the payment status whether success or failure
- then payment is (successfull/failure) message is shown on myfine page with (paid status / pay button) beside that fine
